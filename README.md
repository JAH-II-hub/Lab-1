# Lab 1: JavaScript Functions, Objects, and Prototypes

## Overview

This lab introduces fundamental JavaScript concepts including:
- Different function syntaxes (declarations, expressions, arrow functions)
- Creating and manipulating object literals
- Using Object.create() to establish prototype chains
- Understanding prototype-based inheritance
- Distinguishing between own and inherited properties

## Lab Structure

The lab was divided into four main parts, each having their own dedicated git branch:
- Part 1 - Function declarations and expressions
- Part 2 - Arrow functions with array methods
- Part 3 - Object literals and dynamic property access
- Part 4 - Prototypes, inheritance, and method overriding

## Testing

The codes in this lab can be tested in the browser console in a new private/incognito tab.
